                <h1>Black Onyx</h1>

                <h1>Larimar</h1>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Larimar is a perfect tool for anyone who finds themselves struggling with controlling emotions and communicating how we truly feel within. This stone activates and unlocks our throat chakra and forces one to open themselves up to the loved ones around us and discuss the issues one may be dealing with. This mineral will help keep your mind in a calm state and allow for true emotions from the heart to surface. When one is able to talk through difficulties that they’re facing, one will soon realize there is a solution. Simply letting yourself hear what you have to say will help you better understand yourself and your needs. So often does our mind become foggy or polluted with unnecessary, negative thoughts. When this happens, one will never find a solution to their problems. Larimar is here to show you the inner strength you possess, and the importance to vocalize the issues we hold so close to our hearts.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Larimar is very good stone for anyone who has experienced trauma in their life, but can not seem to move forward from it. This blue form of Pectolite will cool down one’s emotional body and allow space for one to cope. Trauma refuses to ever leave us unless we decide its time to move forward. One should look at these events in their life as a testament to the strength they truly have within, as well as a learning experience about who they really are. Larimar is your “pocket therapist” and will push one towards resolution, relaxation, and an evolution of oneself. One will experience tremendous growth when using Larimar to communicate the pain from within. We recommend wearing a peace around your neck to have it sit as close to ones throat chakra as possible. This will help in the activation of one's throat chakra, as well as helping one remove any anxiety that settled within their chest.</p>

                <h1>Tiger's Eye</h1>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Tiger Eye is a crystal for activating both our personal will and solar plexus chakras. When we open and engage our second brain, known as our gut, we are able to display a true array of emotions and qualities. If we allow ourselves to focus, our possibilities will become limitless and know no bounds. Opportunities and new beginnings will attach to you like a magnet when working this stone. It is up to you as to whether or not you would like to take advantage of what the universe is offering. This ever-loving energy is always actively expanding our consciousness and seeking to push us onto a higher path. Tiger Eye is a small tool that grants us the intuition to follow by feel and not by thought.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Tiger Eye helps one access their inner strength and channel it towards their personal needs and desires. This may come in the forms of creativity, drive, determination, and increased focus. This stone has been known to cause minor “obsessions” within people as it brings out the energetic side. Part of this is contributed to true, pure love being channelled from within our solar plexus chakra into something or someone we truly love. People may observe your actions to be different than what they are used to seeing and problems may arise. That is due in part to your blossoming change which may make others around you uncomfortable with their own path in life. At this point, others may try to spearhead your own personal campaign of self-betterment without even realizing the negative impact they are having. With Tiger Eye, we are able to envision not only our potential but our connections with others around us.</p>   
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">While actively using Tiger Eye eye we may notice ourselves shedding items as well as individuals that no longer suit us. In some cases, this may be personal relationships with whom you may have had a longstanding connection to. Have no fear, as you are beginning to experience a spiritual awakening. As we begin to break through and fully commit ourselves to this positively filled life-path, we may see loved ones as no longer helping us but actually hurting us. Don’t let this discourage your own self growth as others will have their own awakening at their pace. Through peace and love comes acceptance and growth.</p>

                <h1>Sunstone</h1>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Sunstone resonates directly with one’s solar plexus and sacral chakras. It helps align the two, while creating an important communication channel. This specific area of the body houses crucial personal energies such as one's passion, creativity, personal will, and determination. Sunstone’s energies help revitalize these basic components which make up who we are. In addition, it will help channel those energies through your emotional and mental bodies. As the “sunny” rays of this crystal begin to imbue your entire body and aura, one may soon begin to go through a slight transformation process. This can lead to a change in their current lifestyle, including relationships, hobbies, interests, and ideas. The recently ignited fire within you will play a role in each and every decision you make. As soon as a certain event or person enters your life and draws a significant amount of your attention, one will know what this transformation process was constructing for you. This will be a path to total happiness and success. A path only dreamable by people who deem it achievable. The powers of Sunstone will prove what is capable when the body and mind work together in unison.</p>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Working with Sunstone will bring one prosperity, but only through the work ethic you exert. Nothing in the world is free and the price for Sunstone’s energy is time and effort. When one truly puts in every ounce of effort they have, failure is not an option. No matter what the circumstance, we as lightworkers will find a way. Trust your ever growing intuition and lead with your gut as you make challenging choices that can lead you towards your own personal utopia.</p>

                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Using Shungite has multiple effects on the body, including activation of all 7 main chakras. It’s used to detoxify the body and rid the mind of negativity while contributing as an aura cleanser. Shungite is a must-have for people with difficult and uncontrollable emotions. It allows for light to fill the body and negativity to be removed. Due to Shungite’s large deposits, the world is able to see many forms of Shungite. Wearing any piece of jewelry or having any form of it on you will greatly increase your protective shield. Shungite’s deep rooting capability will house sacred energies that can be easily summoned for shielding of any kind. Shungite can also be used to make many elixirs. One very common Elixir would be soaking the stone in water for a brief period of time allowing it to purify. Drinking the purified water is beneficial to cell growth and assisting in the detoxification of our body. Please note, not all Shungite can be properly used for consumption and it’s best to only purchase specific “drink-safe” Shungite products. Please seek out a medical professional to make sure this is safe for you.</p>

                        <p style="text-align: center;">According to Greek mythology, the purple crystal got its name from a young maiden named Amethyst. Apparently Bacchus, the Greek god of passion and partying, became enraged over some insult and vowed to set his tigers after the first mortal he came across. Amethyst was on her way to worship at the temple of Diana, and unfortunately crossed paths with Bacchus. Just before the tigers tore her to pieces, she cried out to Diana for help. Diana heard her cries and the goddess turned Amethyst into a clear crystal stone so the tigers couldn’t hurt her. Bacchus felt guilty, and poured out purple wine over the crystal as an offering, thus turning the stone to purple.</p>

The immense energies of Selenite knows no boundaries when it comes to the restoration of our own auric field and spiritual body. Selenite slices through the air cleansing and recharging any environment it's placed in. It is one of our favorite stones to help remove negative energies that may have been picked up throughout our daily routines. Meditating with a piece over your third eye or crown chakra will allow you to raise your own awareness and intuition levels. Simply put, the expansion effect translates past our own realm and into the dimensions of the dream world. Thoughts, ideas, and visions become more clear, consciously and subconsciously, while awake and asleep.

                        <p style="text-align: center;">To get the most out of your Selenite, try having a piece on you each day, in addition to on your bedside each night! This mineral holds no negative energy and is a tool that can cleanse and recharge your favorite stones and your personal auric field. To achieve this cleansing capability, place the stones you’ve most recently worked with or purchased near or on your Selenite piece and invoke purity into your crystal armory. Also due to Selenite's softness, it can get damaged easily. Never expose it to water or salt.</p>

                <h1>Peridot</h1>
                <h3>Bekka's Birthstone</h3>
                <p style="text-indent: 50px;">Peridot has widely been recognized for its ability to stimulate change between one’s heart and personal will. As our heart releases emotion each day, our sacral chakra is the point of the body that processes it all. Also known as our “second brain”, our gut helps one decipher unstable emotions that may be coming from your most vital organ. During this, a backlog of negative emotions may find themselves embedded in our core, thus causing one anxiety and daily discomfort. Peridot’s green rays facilitate the removal of these feelings through deep meditation and excessive breathing exercises. When one begins to open themselves up to this ancient stone, they must be prepared to fully engage their physical, spiritual, and emotional bodies. All three encompass who we really are, as well as the direction in which we're heading for. When one part of your own personal trinity becomes unbalanced, it can have a drastic effect on all your attributes. Your chakra column is very similar as well and will occasionally need to be realigned and adjusted. Peridot’s energies will offer protection through these personal experiences and help one readjust to the changes in their life.</p>
